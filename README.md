# Browser Based Pedal Board
##ATL WDI Project #4


###Process
  - Web Audio API gets the users audio and runs that through a service to add effects
  - The guitar pedals are stored server-side and created through an ng-repeat.

###Tools
 - Yeoman Angular-Fullstack
 - MEAN Stack
 - Jade
 - Bootstrap
 - Web Audio API
 - Canvas

###Challenges
 - Web Audio API is still relatively new, and difficult to manipulate.

 - Complicated math!
   - All of the effects and visualizations require parsing through

##Planned Updates:
 1. Users can save pedal settings
 2. More effects pedals (Flanger, Auto-wah, Chorus)
 3. Improved UI
 4. Instructions for new users.
 5. More visualizations and guitar tuner
